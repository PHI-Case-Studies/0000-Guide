# Contributing to Case Study Development

Before you read on, please be sure to read the [README](https://github.com/PHI-Case-Studies/Guide/blob/master/README.md) section first.

A great way to get involved in case study development is to use open source cases. An even better way to get involved is contributing to their development. 

To begin contributing:

1. Create a GitHub account.
2. Sign up for a project by cloning a repository.
3. Request to join a team.
4. Study [writing content in Markdown] (https://github.com/PHI-Case-Studies/Guide/blob/master/02%20Markdown%20How-to.md).
